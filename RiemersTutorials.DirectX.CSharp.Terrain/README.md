First part of the Direct X for C# series by Riemers, includes some of my fixes and comments in the code

General considerations

	The DirectX SDK I'm using can be found here: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812

	Once you install it, you can find the referenced .NET assemblies most likely in here C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\DirectX for Managed Code\1.0.2902.0\Microsoft.DirectX.Direct3D.dll

	If you get a badimageformat exceptions or other, remember that this is a .NET 3.5 solution and should be targeting x86 only!

	I'm using Windows 8, Visual Studio 2012, ReSharper and StyleCop to build the exmaples

Hope this is useful

Happy coding :)
